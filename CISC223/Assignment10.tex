	\section*{Q1.}
	Although there exists no program ({\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts}) that can determine if every program terminates given any program and any input, this does not mean that we cannot evaluate an individual program and state that it terminates given a precondition for input and a postcondition for output. The reason that {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts} is uncomputable is that some loops cannot be verified as terminating, not that all loops cannot be verified as terminating. 
	
	\section*{Q2.}
	Assuming that this question is asking us to compare the result of {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont power(2, z)} to the maximum number of atoms in the universe throughout all of time, then yes because our input is limited to the range of {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont int}, which is finite. Since the number of atoms increases indefinitely, the number of atoms in the universe will eventually surpass the maximum value of {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont int}. Therefore, the maximum number of atoms throughout the existence of the universe is greater than any possible input, making the solution to this problem reducible to {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont false}:
	\begin{lstlisting}
bool SizeOfUniverse(int z) {
	return false;
}
	\end{lstlisting}
	\section*{Q3.}
	Assuming that {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll} is implementable, we could write the theoretically unimplementable program {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts}:
	\begin{lstlisting}
bool halts(FILE *func, FILE *arg) {
	//if func terminates for all input, it must terminate for arg
	return HaltsOnAll(&func);
}
	\end{lstlisting}
	Because {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts} is implementable using {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll} as a subroutine, {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts} is reducible to {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll}. By the properties of reducibility, if {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts} is reducible to {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll}, {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll} must be at least as hard as {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts}, and since {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont halts} is unimplementable, therefore {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HaltsOnAll} is unimplementable as well.
